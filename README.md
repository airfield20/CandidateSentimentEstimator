# CandidateSentimentEstimator
Estimate the prevailing sentiment on social media is towards a political candidate using twitter data

## Abstract
Our project will cover the analysis of emotion in tweets directed towards, in reply to, or mentioning political candidates. The goal here is to determine what the prevailing sentiment on social media is towards this candidate. To this end, we will be using a decision tree classifier to judge the emotional sentiment of a given tweet. The classifier will likely be trained using annotated data obtained from the _SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets Data_ or _EmoInt2017 Data_. The target candidate is not chosen yet, but once we have a candidate to examine, we will generate a set of recent tweets sampled from across the US targeted towards, replying to, or mentioning that candidate and apply the classifier to determine overall sentiment.
