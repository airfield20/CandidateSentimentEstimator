You hypocrites forget about every other president until Trump. Obama's SECOND Chief of Staff (Rouse), only lasted 104 days, his THIRD (Daley) 379 days, and his FOURTH (Lew) 359 days. 2018-12-08T23:59:57 N

Impeaching Trump is what the majority of American voters want but Republicans in the senate will not allow that. Come 2020 election, do not vote for Senators supporting Trump in 2020. 2018-12-08T23:59:53 N
Forget this. The President’s actual “Trump” card is starting a conflict with Iran. The drumbeat has been steadily growing louder & the case, dubious as it is, keeps getting made.

I think the anger is there all along - it's the anger of old people who don't want change and who've become irrelevant. Anger is a big part of the Trump appeal, and the Brexit appeal. Politicians like Hanson and Trump give the angry an avenue and somewhere to lay blame. 2018-12-08T23:59:50 N

Trump likes to be ahead of the game, so humans, be gone! I am  no admirer of Kelly, either, though. He echoed Trump's policies and encouraged the separation of families at the border. Good riddance! Too bad it's not both of them! 2018-12-08T23:59:34 P

Of course, @realDonaldTrump / @POTUS / @WhiteHouse will say it's Right for Trump to try to destroy a comedian's career because she made fun of him. Wrong.
