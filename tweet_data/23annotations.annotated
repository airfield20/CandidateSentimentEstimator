You hypocrites forget about every other president until Trump. Obama's SECOND Chief of Staff (Rouse), only lasted 104 days, his THIRD (Daley) 379 days, and his FOURTH (Lew) 359 days. 2018-12-08T23:59:57 N
He will be drinking and dancing the jig for joy over the holidays that it is over. He sure tried. But Trump listens to no one. 2018-12-08T23:59:57 N

Exactly why we no longer need or want to be associated with Saudia Arabia. Trump defends and assists the murdering Saudi prince! 2018-12-08T23:59:54 N
Impeaching Trump is what the majority of American voters want but Republicans in the senate will not allow that. Come 2020 election, do not vote for Senators supporting Trump in 2020. 2018-12-08T23:59:53 N
Forget this. The President’s actual “Trump” card is starting a conflict with Iran. The drumbeat has been steadily growing louder & the case, dubious as it is, keeps getting made. Then he’ll declare that Mueller must suspend or end his investigation “for the good of the country”. https://twitter.com/TheAtlantic/status/1071514285094899713 … 2018-12-08T23:59:53 N

If Donald Trump, Michael Cohen, Mike Flynn and the rest collectively do less time than #CyntoiaBrown we really do need to rethink the #Law #CohenSentencingMemo #impeachment 2018-12-08T23:59:52 N

I think the anger is there all along - it's the anger of old people who don't want change and who've become irrelevant. Anger is a big part of the Trump appeal, and the Brexit appeal. Politicians like Hanson and Trump give the angry an avenue and somewhere to lay blame. 2018-12-08T23:59:50 N
@GeraldoRivera, like many others, drank the @realDonaldTrump kool aid and ruined his reputation as a result. 2018-12-08T23:59:48 N
